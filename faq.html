<h3>What is the conference about?</h3>

<p>
The theme of our conference, human 2.0, centers on assistive and augmentative technologies at the intersection of biology, engineering, and medicine. At the forefront of this emerging field are cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to repair or replace damaged or missing organs and that may even provide people with “superhuman” capabilities.   </p>
 
 <p>
Speakers at the conference will present cutting-edge research in areas ranging from next-generation prosthetics to integrated tissue/microelectronic systems. The schedule and speakers can be found at the links above, and a student poster session will provide a glimpse of some of the research being conducted in this field at the undergraduate and graduate level.</p>
 
<h3>When and where is the conference?</h3>
<p>
The conference will be held at Stanford University’s Clark Center Auditorium on <strong>Saturday, April 26, 2014</strong> from 10:00 AM - 4:30 PM.  Check-in and a breakfast reception will begin at 9:30am.</p>
 
<h3>Who should attend?</h3>

<p>Because the focus of this conference is distinctly interdisciplinary, students interested in everything from the life sciences (biology, chemistry) to engineering and CS would find the conference to be extremely informative and engaging.</p>
 
 <p>
The topics covered in this conference also apply to fields outside STEM. For example, the growth in use of assistive and augmentative technologies is bound to bring up new ethical questions and also touches on psychological and sociological issues.</p>
 
 <p>
As such, just about ANYONE interested in learning about how advances in medical and engineering technology may be applied in the human body should attend.</p>

<h3>What is the conference schedule?</h3>
<p>
A morning reception (with light food and refreshments) begins at 9:30 AM. The formal conference program promptly begins at 10:00 AM ends at around 4:30 PM. In between is lunch (provided by Ike’s!) at noon and a brief break (with refreshments) at 3:00 PM.</p>

<p>For a list of speakers and the times of their talks, go <a href = "schedule.html">here</a>.</p>
 
<h3>Is it free? Are tickets required?</h3>
<p>
It is completely free to attend for all Stanford undergraduate and graduate students! We do ask that attendees resister so that we can obtain a head count for resfreshments and lunch, which are both provided at no charge to all conference participants. For industry professionals, tickets can be purchahed for $30 starting March 15th. 
</p>
<h3>Is lunch and food provided?</h3>
<p>
Yes, we will have lunch provided by Ike’s! Light refreshments will also be provided at the morning reception (at 9:30 AM) and the afternoon break (3:00 PM).</p>
 
<h3>How can I present my research at the poster session?</h3>
<p>Please submit your abstract <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yQ1V5ev5t_I8nMnxa26ol6hGQ-wbftf9Hd5cxEos7Ck/viewform">here</a>. Click on the <a href = "poster.html">posters</a> tab to learn more about this chance to share your research with visiting faculty, Stanford professors, and local industry professionals!</p>
