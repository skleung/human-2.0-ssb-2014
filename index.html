          <h4> What is human 2.0?</h4>
        </div>
        <span class = "big">human2.0</span> seeks to expose attendees to <strong>cutting-edge research</strong> at the intersection of <strong>biology</strong>,<strong> engineering</strong>, and <strong>medicine</strong>. The theme of the conference centers around the ideas of augmentation - using technology to liberate human capabilities from current biological constraints - and regeneration - replacing or regrowing damaged or missing organs and tissues. Through engaging speakers, panels, and a poster presentation, this conference will touch on topics ranging from the next-generation prosthetcis and stem-cell based organ regeneration to robotic exoskeletons and integrated tissue/microelectronic systems

          <p>Dr. David Magnus is the Director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics and is a Thomas A. Raffin Professor of Medicine and Biomedical Ethics at Stanford University. Dr. Magnus serves as President of the American Bioethics Program Directors and as Co-Editor of the American Journal of Bioethics and is widely published on a range of topics, including health care reform, research ethics, end-of-life care, and genetic technology. At <strong>human2.0</strong>, he will engage the audience in a discussion about the ethical implications of human augmentation and these concerns will influence the trajectory of these fields and technologies in the coming decades. </p>

        <p>Sheila Nirenberg is a neuroscientist exploring fundamental questions about how the brain encodes visual information and developing an alternative approach to restoring sight after photoreceptor cell degeneration. Dr. Nirenberg invented a computerized eyeglass prosthetic that transmits the codes to the ganglion cells, which then send the codes to the brain.  In another line of research, Dr.Nirenberg is adapting and applying her discoveries in neural coding to machine vision algorithms with the goal of advancing the state of the art in robotic “vision” and brain-machine interfaces. She is currently a professor in Department of Physiology and Biophysics and a member of the Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Medical College of Cornell University. She has won numerous awards for innovative research, including the MacArthur Fellowship, a Klingenstein Fellowship, a UCLA Frontiers of Science award, a Stein Oppenheimer award, and a Whitehall Foundation award.</p>

            <p>Michael Goldfarb is a professor of mechanical engineering at Vanderbilt and a coinventor of a robot exoskeleton that helps the paralyzed walk again. Using an advanced system of onboard embedded microprocessors and sensors, the exoskeleton is able to adapt to the wearer’s level of muscle control and even electrically enervate muscle in limbs for certain kinds of paralysis.  Speaking on behalf of the Goldfarb lab, Dr. Brian Lawson will discuss the technology that allows devices like the exoskeleton (as well as a robotic leg prostheses developed by the Goldfarb lab) to actively interact with a wearer’s actions and closely simulate natural movement.</p>
